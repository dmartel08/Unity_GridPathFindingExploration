# Unity_GridPathFindingExploration
A personal project building path-finding from scratch.

Currently contains a Unity package with a tile and gridpath prefab with associated scripts.

Import the Unity package into a scene/project.
Bring the GridPath.prefab and GridPath_UI.prefab into the scene. 
Hook up the UI buttons to their respective functions located on the WavePathFinder object.
Toggle settings for the grid size. Toggle settings for the source, target, and pathfinding grid limit values.

Given a valid grid limit, source, and target position, "Find Path" should create a path of debug lines that arrive at the destination.
